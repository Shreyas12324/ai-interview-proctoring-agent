SCORING GUIDELINES (Be honest and fair - don't inflate scores):
- 9-10: Exceptional - Expert-level answers, clear communication, outstanding depth
- 7-8: Strong - Good technical knowledge, well-articulated, minor gaps
- 5-6: Adequate - Meets basic requirements, some unclear areas, room for improvement
- 3-4: Below Average - Significant gaps, struggled with questions, needs development
- 1-2: Poor - Major deficiencies, minimal understanding, very brief answers
- 0: No participation or ended immediately

IMPORTANT: Most candidates should score in the 4-7 range. Reserve 8+ for truly impressive answers.
Give credit for effort and partial knowledge, but be honest about gaps.

Generate feedback in JSON format:

    "weaknesses": ["weakness 1", "weakness 2"],
    "recommendations": ["recommendation 1", "recommendation 2", "recommendation 3"]

Base scores on:
- Technical accuracy and depth (not just answering, but quality of answers)
- Communication clarity and structure
- Confidence and professionalism
- Ability to articulate complex thoughts
- Handling of follow-up questions"""

EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS:

4. If good (clear answers with examples, demonstrates knowledge): Score 7-8 range
5. If exceptional (expert-level, insightful, excellent communication): Score 9-10 range

Analyze each answer for:
- Depth: Did they provide details/examples or just brief statements?
- Relevance: Did they answer the actual question asked?
- Technical accuracy: Were their statements correct?
- Communication: Were answers well-structured and clear?

Be fair but honest. Don't inflate scores. Most interviews should fall in 4-7 range.
